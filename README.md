## **Introduction**

<a id="introduction"></a>
My name is Sarah Lopez. I'm a first year Web Development student at RVCC and this is my first big project. I have dabbled in coding here and there over the years, but I have never made something on this scale before.

## **Description**

<a id="description"></a>
This project was constructed over the course of a semester. Each week, a new Web Development topic would be introduced and would then be incorporated into the About Me page. These topics included:

####Adding HTML, Images & Links
Introduction to basic HTML. The project begins as a blank page. An avatar and brief description are added.

####Adding Some Style
Introduction to CSS and designing color schemes with accessibility in mind.

####Tell Me More
Gallery section is added along with figcaptions.

####Responsive Design
Adding a responsive design with media queries for users viewing the page on a phone, tablet, or desktop.

####Embedded Media
An introduction to iframes. A video is added to the page.

####Web Forms
A functioning Contact form is added and styled.

####Nav Bar
A horizontal nav bar on the top of the page is added.

## **Article**

For the article section, I decided to research and write about animating SVG images. In the article, I use two examples. The first one is the avatar from the page's header, and the other one is a logo I designed myself in Visual Design I.

## **Color Scheme**

<a id="colors"></a>
I decided to go with an analogous color scheme because they tend to be more soothing and harmonious than, say, a complementary color scheme. There's a lot of violet, peach, and blue.

Color 1:
RGB: 9, 70, 107
Hex: #09466B

Color 2:
RGB: 156, 160, 222
Hex: #9CA0DE

Color 3:
RGB: 240, 211, 206
Hex: #F0D3CE

Color 4:
RGB: 117, 29, 100
Hex: #751D64

Color 5:
RGB: 53, 17, 17
Hex: #351111

## **Background Image**

<a id="background"></a>
For the background, I decided to spice it up with a more personal touch. I scanned a watercolor illustration from my sketchbook into Photoshop, made it into a repeating pattern, and adjusted the colors so that they would match with the site. Although the page has nothing to do with food, the illustrative hand-drawn style of the background image reinforces the general laid-back and playful quality of this project.

## **Logo**

<a id="logo"></a>The Logo is something I put together in Illustrator. My goal was to take my initials and use the visual elements of typography to create an image. The S in my name represents a lock of hair and the L is a nose. The colors used in the logo reflect the colors used on the page.
