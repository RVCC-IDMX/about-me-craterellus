## **Introduction**

<a id="introduction"></a>
My name is Sarah Lopez. I'm a first year Web Development student at RVCC and this is my first big project. I have dabbled in coding here and there over the years, but I have never made something on this scale before.  


## **Description**

<a id="description"></a>
My About Me is about...me! The page is broken up into several sections, which can be accessed at the nav bar on the top right portion of the page. These sections include: 

Bio:
Candy striped list, headers 

Gallery: learned how to insert photos and make them look different for different screens 

Blog: This includes an article I have written about  

Contact me: A form that visitors can fill out and send feedback. Through making this, I learned to implement inputs. 

And here are some additional features: 

Video: learned how to use iframes 

Avatar 

Navbar itself: 

Adding HTML, Images & Links


 


## **Color Scheme**

<a id="colors"></a>
I decided to go with an analogous color scheme because they tend to be more soothing and harmonious than, say, a complementary color scheme. There's a lot of violet, peach, and blue.

Color 1:
RGB: 9, 70, 107
Hex: #09466B

Color 2:
RGB: 156, 160, 222
Hex: #9CA0DE

Color 3:
RGB: 240, 211, 206
Hex: #F0D3CE

Color 4:
RGB: 117, 29, 100
Hex: #751D64

Color 5:
RGB: 53, 17, 17
Hex: #351111

## **Background Image**

<a id="background"></a>
For the background, I decided to spice it up with a more personal touch. I scanned a watercolor illustration from my sketchbook into Photoshop, made it into a repeating pattern, and adjusted the colors so that they would match with the site. Although the page has nothing to do with food, the illustrative, hand-drawn style of the background image reinforces the general laid-back and playful quality of this project.

## **Logo**

<a id="logo"></a>The Logo is something I put together in Illustrator. My goal was to take my initials and use the visual elements of typography to create an image. The S in my name represents a lock of hair and the L is a nose. The colors used in the logo reflect the colors used on the page.
